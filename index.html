      <div class="text"><b>Q: WHO HAS A TESTIMONY?</b><br /><br />
        <b>Ayokunle:</b> 🙋‍♂️ I do.....<br /><br />
        <b>Mod:</b> Okay, you know we have a lot of testifiers, so we give you the chance to say just few words. Have it
        🎤<br /><br />
        <b>Ayokunle:</b> (Testing 🎤🗣️) I give God praise for making me know Past Grace. She's a model of
        righteousness.
        Though we're not so close but I've really learnt a lot from her. I love your voice Mama🏃🏃🏃<br /><br />
        <b>Mod:</b> 1 minute more<br /><br />
        <b>Ayokunle:</b> 😲😞Okay. So there was a day I met her on my way to school in the morning. She was waiting for
        bus and I greeted her and so did one other RCF member. I planned inside me to pay the t.fare for three (I can't
        pay for Mama and leave the guy) but also considering my money 😥😥(that's bad of me). And then she spoke to us
        not
        to worry about the t.fare🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️. Last last, she paid tfar3 for four (+her friend or so). Mehn, I was
        flabbergasted. That's the second time a leader in RCF will do something like that for me (and that made me
        conclude it's their dominant trait)...... Past Grace, God looks <u>good</u> on you. Thanks, I love you ma.<br />
